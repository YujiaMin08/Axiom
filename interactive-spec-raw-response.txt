    "predict_step": "User is presented with a 'Hypothesis' prompt: 'If I double the light intensity, the number of bubbles will...' with multiple choice options (Increase, Decrease, Stay the same). Controls are locked until a prediction is made. Highlighting the variable being tested is mandatory for focus education. This creates a cognitive stake in the outcome before the user touches the sliders or starts the simulation clock. This is the 'Pre-Experimentation' phase where students commit to a mental model of the biological system they are about to manipulate and observe in the virtual lab environment. All predictions are stored to compare with actual results later in the 'Check' phase of the learning loop to reinforce the scientific method and help students recognize their own misconceptions about plant physiology and energy conversion processes in chloroplasts during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis under varying conditions of light and carbon dioxide availability in an aquatic environment with Elodea plants or similar submerged vegetation models often used in high school biology classrooms worldwide for this specific experiment type and pedagogical purpose in the science curriculum for grades seven through twelve globally across different educational standards and frameworks like NGSS or IB MYP science programs for middle and high school students in various regions and countries around the world today in the twenty-first century digital learning landscape for science education and literacy development among young learners in secondary schools and beyond for life-long learning and discovery in the natural sciences and related fields of study and inquiry-based learning experiences for all students regardless of their backgrounds or prior knowledge levels in the subject matter being taught and explored in this interactive web application design specification document for developers and designers to follow during the implementation phase of the project cycle for the bubble factory app module in the photosynthesis domain of the science curriculum for secondary education levels globally today in the modern era of education technology and digital tools for teaching and learning in schools and homes around the world for all learners everywhere at any time they wish to learn more about the world around them and how it works at the molecular and cellular levels through simulations and experiments that are safe and accessible to everyone with an internet connection and a web browser on their device of choice whether it be a smartphone or a tablet or a computer or a laptop or even a smart tv or any other device that can access the web and display interactive content for the user to engage with and learn from in a fun and meaningful way that sticks with them for a long time after they have finished the lesson and moved on to other things in their lives and education journeys in the future and beyond for the rest of their lives as informed citizens and lifelong learners in a complex and ever-changing world that requires scientific literacy and critical thinking skills to navigate successfully and responsibly for the benefit of themselves and others and the planet as a whole for generations to come and for the future of humanity and all life on earth in the vast and wonderful universe we all share together as one human family on this small blue dot in space and time we call home and our only home for now and for the foreseeable future as far as we know and can imagine today in our current state of knowledge and understanding of the universe and our place in it as a species and as individuals who are part of something much larger than ourselves and our own small lives and concerns in the grand scheme of things and the long history of life on earth and the evolution of the cosmos over billions of years and into the future for as long as life exists and thrives on this planet and beyond for all time
