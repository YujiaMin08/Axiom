  "learning_path_reasoning": "The path begins by establishing the 'why' (intuition) before introducing the technical 'what' (definition). Because Red-Black trees are abstract, the 'manipulation' module is placed early to allow students to feel the mechanics of rotations before they are asked to apply them in the 'experiment' phase. The mathematical perspective provides the formal 'expression' of why this data structure is superior, and the final challenge serves as the 'verification' of their mastery over the complex balancing rules."
