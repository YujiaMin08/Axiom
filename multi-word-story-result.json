  "title": "The Stargazer and the Apple of Envy",
  "narrative_text": "Leo spent his evenings sketching constellations, dreaming of owning the new \"Stargazer 5000\" telescope (望远镜). He imagined exploring nebulae, feeling the vastness of space. Then, one sunny afternoon, he watched his neighbor, Chloe, unbox the very same model, a gift from her enthusiastic aunt. A sharp, uncomfortable pang of jealousy (嫉妒) twisted in Leo's stomach. Why her? He felt an unfairness that clouded his usual cheerful demeanor.Days later, strolling past Chloe’s yard, Leo spotted a perfect, glossy red apple (苹果) nestled amongst fallen leaves, clearly having rolled from her picnic basket. His initial thought, still shadowed by envy, was to keep it. \"She has the telescope, I'll take her apple,\" a childish voice echoed. But something held him back; a flicker of his better judgment. The following morning, Leo overheard Chloe explaining to her parents that the \"Stargazer\" had a critical lens defect. They were making arrangements for a full refund (退款). Her voice held genuine disappointment. Hearing this, Leo's petty jealousy evaporated, replaced by empathy. He walked over, apple in hand. \"This fell from your basket,\" he offered, a genuine smile finally replacing his resentment. Chloe thanked him, and they started discussing their shared love for the night sky, realizing connection was more fulfilling than envy.",
