    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "In 'The Bubble Factory' experiment, if you maximized the Light Intensity but the bubble rate eventually stopped increasing, which phenomenon were you likely observing?",
        "question_type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "The Law of Limiting Factors",
          "The Greenhouse Effect",
          "Chlorophyll Depletion",
          "Phototropism"
        ],
        "answer_index": 0,
        "explanation": "When the rate of photosynthesis plateaus despite increasing one factor (like light), it means another factor, such as CO2 concentration or temperature, has become the limiting factor that prevents further growth.",
        "difficulty": "medium",
        "source_module": "The Bubble Factory experiment"
      },
      {
        "question": "If you were to set the Ambient Temperature in the simulation to 50°C (122°F), why would the production of bubbles likely drop to near zero?",
        "question_type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "The water evaporates too quickly for the plant to drink",
          "High temperatures denature the enzymes that drive the chemical reaction",
          "The plant enters a state of hibernation to save energy",
          "Light cannot penetrate water at high temperatures"
        ],
        "answer_index": 1,
        "explanation": "Photosynthesis is an enzyme-driven process. Just as we saw in the experiment, every plant has an optimal temperature; exceeding this causes enzymes to lose their shape (denature) and stop functioning.",
        "difficulty": "hard",
        "source_module": "The Bubble Factory experiment"
      },
      {
        "question": "True or False: In the simulation, increasing the CO2 Concentration will result in an infinite linear increase in oxygen production, regardless of the Light Intensity setting.",
        "question_type": "true_false",
        "options": [
          "True",
          "False"
        ],
        "answer_index": 1,
        "explanation": "This is false. Photosynthesis requires a balance of inputs. If Light Intensity is low, adding more CO2 will not increase the rate because the plant lacks the light energy to process the extra carbon.",
        "difficulty": "easy",
        "source_module": "The Bubble Factory experiment"
      },
      {
        "question": "A student wants to simulate a plant living in a sun-drenched desert at noon. Which configuration of parameters in 'The Bubble Factory' would be most accurate?",
        "question_type": "scenario_based",
        "options": [
          "Low Light Intensity, High CO2, Low Temperature",
          "High Light Intensity, Low CO2, Medium Temperature",
          "High Light Intensity, Medium CO2, High Temperature",
          "Medium Light Intensity, Medium CO2, Low Temperature"
        ],
        "answer_index": 2,
        "explanation": "A desert at noon provides maximum Light Intensity and High Ambient Temperature. This scenario tests your ability to map real-world environmental conditions to the experimental variables used in the module.",
        "difficulty": "medium",
        "source_module": "The Bubble Factory experiment"
      },
      {
        "question": "In 'The Bubble Factory,' the bubbles released by the plant are a direct measurement of which photosynthetic byproduct?",
        "question_type": "multiple_choice",
        "options": [
          "Carbon Dioxide",
          "Glucose",
          "Oxygen",
          "Nitrogen"
        ],
        "answer_index": 2,
        "explanation": "The bubbles observed in the experiment are oxygen gas. During photosynthesis, water molecules are split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct while the plant creates energy in the form of glucose.",
        "difficulty": "easy",
        "source_module": "The Bubble Factory experiment"
      }
    ],
    "quiz_strategy": "The questions are designed to transition the student from the interactive 'Bubble Factory' simulation to theoretical mastery. By referencing the specific parameters (Light, CO2, Temp) and the visual feedback (bubbles), the quiz reinforces the concept of limiting factors and enzyme sensitivity, moving from simple identification to complex scenario application."
