# Solar Powered Life: How Plants Make Their Own Food

Imagine you want to build a house. You need bricks, wood, and concrete. Now, what if you could just get sunlight, some invisible air, and water, and *poof* – a house appears out of nowhere? Sounds like magic, right?

Well, plants do something just as incredible every single day! Look at a tiny seed, then imagine the giant tree it can become. Where does all that **mass** (质量) – all that wood, bark, leaves, and fruit – come from? It doesn't just suck it all out of the soil. Plants have a secret power: they make their own food and building materials using sunlight and air!

## The Plant's Solar Factory: Photosynthesis

This amazing process is called **photosynthesis** (光合作用). It's how plants literally turn thin air and water into solid matter, powered by the sun. Think of each plant, especially its leaves, as a tiny, highly efficient solar-powered factory.

### The Ingredients (Inputs)

Just like any factory, a plant needs raw materials to get started. For photosynthesis, these are:

*   **Sunlight** (太阳光): This is the energy source, like electricity powering a factory. Without sunlight, the factory can't run.
*   **Carbon Dioxide (CO2)** (二氧化碳): This invisible gas comes directly from the air around us. It's the main

## 🎯 提取的关键要点

1. Plants create their own food and building materials through a process called **photosynthesis** (光合作用).

2. The main ingredients (inputs) for photosynthesis are **sunlight** (energy), **carbon dioxide** (from air), and **water** (from soil).

3. **Chlorophyll** (叶绿素), the green pigment in plants, is essential for capturing sunlight energy.

4. The products (outputs) of photosynthesis are **sugar** (the plant's food and building blocks) and **oxygen** (released into the air).

5. Photosynthesis is fundamental to almost all life on Earth, providing food and the oxygen we breathe.
