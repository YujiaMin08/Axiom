It then moves into the core scientific 'perspective_physics' and 'perspective_biology' modules to explain the underlying mechanics of heat transfer and physiological response. The 'manipulation' module provides a hands-on way to visualize the abstract concept of conductivity. Finally, the 'perspective_culture' and 'challenge' modules transition the knowledge into real-world context and practical application, ensuring the student understands both the theory and the consequences."
