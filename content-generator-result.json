  "body": "# Solar Powered Life: How Plants Make Their Own Food\n\nHave you ever wondered how a tiny seed grows into a towering tree, or how a vast field of grass sustains so many animals? It's not magic, it's **photosynthesis** (光合作用)! Plants are incredible chemists, performing a seemingly impossible feat: turning invisible gases and sunlight into solid matter – their own food.\n\n## The Ultimate Plant Recipe\n\nImagine you're making a delicious meal. You need ingredients and energy to cook them, right? Plants are no different, but their 'kitchen' is their leaves, and their 'ingredients' are incredibly simple:\n\n1.  **Sunlight (太阳光)**: This is the energy source, like the heat from your stove. Plants capture this energy.\n2.  **Water (水)**: Absorbed from the soil through their roots.\n3.  **Carbon Dioxide (二氧化碳)**: An invisible gas taken from the air through tiny pores on their leaves.\n\nWith these three simple things, plants create their own food! This process, where 'photo' means light and 'synthesis' means to make, is literally ",

    "Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make their own food.",
    "Plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide as ingredients for photosynthesis.",
    "The main products of photosynthesis are sugar (plant food/energy) and oxygen.",
    "Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, is essential for capturing sunlight.",
    "Photosynthesis is vital for almost all life on Earth, providing food and the oxygen we breathe."
