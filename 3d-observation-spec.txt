**Topic:** 3D Spatial Visualization and Perspective
**Domain:** Mathematics / Science (Physics/Engineering)
**Module:** "3D Object Observer"
**Learning Goal:** Develop spatial reasoning by understanding orthographic projection (how 3D objects translate into 2D "Top," "Front," and "Side" views).

### SPECIFICATIONS:

**1. The Interactive Loop (Predict → Observe → Understand)**
The app must center on a "Reveal" mechanic. Students should look at a 3D object, mentally predict its 2D silhouette from a specific angle, and then click to reveal the actual projection to confirm their mental model.

**2. Adjustable Parameters (The Controls)**
*   **Object Selector:** A toggle or dropdown to switch between 4 shapes:
    *   *Simple:* A Cube.
    *   *Curved:* A Cylinder.
    *   *Complex:* An L-shaped block (stairs).
    *   *Compound:* A simple House (rectangular prism with a triangular prism roof and a small offset chimney).
*   **View Presets:** Four buttons: "Free Rotate," "Top View," "Front View," and "Right Side View."
*   **Visual Style Toggle:** A switch between "Solid" and "Wireframe" mode (to help students see internal edges/hidden lines).

**3. Visual Feedback & Display**
*   **Main 3D Stage:** A large central area where the 3D object sits on a faint grid. Users can click and drag to rotate the object freely.
*   **The Projection Panes:** Three small, empty 2D square boxes labeled "Top," "Front," and "Side." 
    *   Each box initially contains a "Click to Reveal" button.
    *   Once clicked, the 2D silhouette (orthographic projection) of the current object appears in that box.
    *   If the user rotates the 3D object, the 2D projections should update in real-time (if they have been revealed).
*   **Camera Alignment:** When a user clicks a "View" button (e.g., "Top View"), the 3D camera must smoothly animate to that exact perspective, aligning perfectly with the corresponding 2D Projection Pane.

**4. Educational Explanations (Progressive Disclosure)**
*   **The "Discovery" Text:** When a 2D view is revealed, a short caption appears. 
    *   *Example (Cylinder Side View):* "Notice how the curved surface of the cylinder becomes a flat rectangle when seen from the side. Depth is lost in 2D."
    *   *Example (House Top View):* "From above, the sloped roof looks like two flat rectangles. The chimney appears as a small square."
*   **The "Spatial Tip":** A small info-box that updates based on the object selected, explaining "Hidden Lines" (e.g., "In wireframe mode, you can see the back edges that are normally hidden from your view").

**5. Design Philosophy**
*   **Clean & Minimalist:** Use a neutral light-gray background. The 3D objects should be a vibrant color (e.g., teal or orange) to stand out.
*   **No Distractions:** No timers, scores, or complex menus. The focus is entirely on the relationship between the 3D shape and its 2D shadows.
*   **Single-File Implementation:** The app should be built using a lightweight 3D library (like Three.js) or CSS 3D transforms, contained entirely within one HTML file.

**6. Exploration Mechanics**
*   **The "Match" Challenge:** When a user switches to a new object, the 2D Projection Panes should automatically "hide" again (reset to "Click to Reveal"). This forces the student to re-predict the 2D shapes for the new geometry.
*   **Synchronized Highlighting:** When a user hovers over a face in the 3D view, the corresponding line/shape in the 2D Projection Panes should highlight to show the direct relationship.
