Baristas often use phrases like 'What can I get for you?' or 'Anything else?' to manage the ordering process. Knowing the difference between 'for here' (to consume in the cafe) and 'to go' (for takeaway) is essential for a smooth transaction. While sizes might vary, 'small', 'regular' (often meaning medium), and 'large' are common terms."
