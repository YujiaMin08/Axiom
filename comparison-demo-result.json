  "similarities": [
    "Both processes utilize an Electron Transport Chain (ETC) to create a proton gradient.",

  "differences": [
    "Photosynthesis is an anabolic process (building molecules), whereas cellular respiration is a catabolic process (breaking molecules down).",
    "The waste products of photosynthesis (Oxygen) are the necessary inputs for respiration, and vice versa.",
    "Photosynthesis requires an external energy source (sunlight), while respiration relies on internal stored energy (glucose)."
